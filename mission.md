# Our Mission

We aim to empower teens to understand their menstrual cycles with:
- Accessible tracking tools  
- Clear, youth-friendly educational resources  
- A supportive community focused on well-being  

By offering a simple, informative platform, we hope to help teens feel confident and informed about their bodies.
