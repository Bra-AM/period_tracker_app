  <h1>About</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The idea for this app was born when my little sister first started her period. I wanted to help her feel informed, comfortable, and prepared—yet every period-tracking app I found was overwhelming, dense, or simply not designed for younger audiences. As I spoke with more women, from teenagers to college students, I realized they too were dissatisfied with existing apps. Many struggled to understand their cycles, and the information they received in schools or at home felt incomplete.</p>

    <p>Parents also voiced their concerns. Some wanted to share more detailed knowledge about topics like sexual health, hormones, and cycle tracking; others preferred a more gradual approach. They needed a resource that could adapt to each family’s comfort level. Seeing this universal need for a teen-friendly, parent-approved, and truly empowering platform, I decided to build an app that would close these gaps—one that balances in-depth knowledge with a thoughtful presentation for young minds.</p>
